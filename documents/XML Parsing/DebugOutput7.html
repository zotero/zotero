{"text":"Here is your refined summary with duplicated section titles 
removed:\n\n---\n\n### üëã Welcome to DeepTutor!\n\nI'm your AI tutor ü§ñ 
ready to help you understand this document.\n\n### üí° Key Takeaway\nüß† 
**A single fear-inducing stimulus triggers a long-lasting, 
transcription-dependent switch in synaptic **AMPAR** phenotype in 
cerebellar stellate cells‚Äîvia noradrenaline, action potential 
broadening, Ca$^{2+}$ influx, and ERK/MAPK signaling‚Äîthat increases 
synaptic incorporation of GluR2-containing, Ca$^{2+}$-impermeable **AMPA
 receptors**.**\n\n### üìö Document Overview\n- **A single fear-inducing 
stimulus** triggers a long-lasting, transcription-dependent switch in 
synaptic **AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype** in cerebellar stellate 
cells.\n- This switch involves increased **GluR2 mRNA** and synaptic 
incorporation of **GluR2-containing, Ca$^{2+}$-impermeable AMPARs**, 
replacing GluR2-lacking, Ca$^{2+}$-permeable receptors.\n- The process 
is mediated by **noradrenaline**, which prolongs action potentials, 
enhances Ca$^{2+}$ entry, and activates **ERK/MAPK signaling** to drive 
new GluR2 gene transcription.\n- This **phenotype switch** alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.\n\n### üìå Fear-induced switch in synaptic 
AMPAR phenotype\n- A **single fear-inducing stimulus** triggers a 
transcription-dependent switch in synaptic **AMPAR phenotype** in 
cerebellar stellate cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca$^{2+}$-permeable) to GluR2-containing (Ca$^{2+}$-impermeable) 
receptors within hours.\n- This switch is driven by **noradrenaline**, 
which prolongs action potentials, increases Ca$^{2+}$ entry, and 
activates the **ERK/MAPK pathway** to boost *GluR2* gene 
transcription.\n- The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic 
function, potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural 
networks in response to fear.\n\n### üìå Role of noradrenaline and 
Œ≤-adrenergic receptors\n- **Noradrenaline** released during emotional 
arousal activates **Œ≤-adrenergic receptors** in the brain, especially in
 cerebellar stellate cells.\n- Activation of Œ≤-adrenergic receptors 
increases action potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, 
triggering ERK/MAPK signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a 
switch in synaptic **AMPAR phenotype**.\n- This process enables a 
long-lasting change in synaptic strength and may underlie how emotional 
experiences modify learning and memory.\n\n### üìå Mechanism: Action 
potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 
transcription\n- **Action potential broadening** increases **Ca$^{2+}$ 
entry** through L-type channels, activating the **ERK/MAPK signaling** 
pathway.\n- This cascade triggers **GluR2 gene transcription**, leading 
to more **GluR2-containing AMPARs** at synapses and a switch in receptor
 phenotype.\n\n### üìå Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity\n- **Transcription-dependent synaptic plasticity** involves 
long-lasting changes in synaptic strength that require new gene 
transcription, such as the noradrenaline-triggered switch to 
GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear stimuli.\n- 
**Transcription-independent synaptic plasticity** relies on rapid 
mechanisms like receptor trafficking or local protein synthesis, 
enabling fast changes in synaptic function without altering gene 
expression.\n- **Key difference:** Transcription-dependent changes occur
 over hours and affect the whole neuron, while transcription-independent
 changes happen within minutes and are often synapse-specific.\n\n### üìå
 Functional consequences for inhibitory neural circuits\n- **Inhibitory 
neural circuits** can undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength 
when a single fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent 
upregulation of GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.\n- This 
switch reduces **Ca$^{2+}$ permeability** at synapses, altering 
**synaptic efficacy** and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.\n- **Noradrenaline** and **action potential 
broadening** are key signals that activate the **ERK/MAPK pathway**, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.\n\n---\n### üí¨ Ask

\n| **Molecular Identity**    | GluR2 is a subunit of AMPA-type 
glutamate receptors (AMPARs). [&lt;9&gt;][&lt;1&gt;]                    
                                                                        
               | It is essential for forming functional AMPARs that 
determine the specific properties of these receptors at synapses. 
[&lt;9&gt;][&lt;4&gt;]             |\n| **Role in AMPAR Function**| 
AMPARs containing GluR2 are Ca$^{2+}$-impermeable, whereas receptors 
lacking GluR2 allow Ca$^{2+}$ influx. [&lt;1&gt;][&lt;9&gt;]            
                                                  | This role is 
critical because the presence of GluR2 limits Ca$^{2+}$ entry, thereby 
stabilizing synaptic transmission and protecting cells. 
[&lt;1&gt;][&lt;4&gt;]   |\n| **Ca$^{2+}$ Permeability**| The 
incorporation of GluR2 into AMPARs prevents excessive Ca$^{2+}$ influx. 
[&lt;1&gt;][&lt;6&gt;]                                                  
                                              | By reducing Ca$^{2+}$ 
permeability, GluR2 helps maintain synaptic stability and protects 
against calcium-induced excitotoxicity. [&lt;1&gt;][&lt;6&gt;]    |\n| 
**Transcriptional Regulation**| GluR2 expression is regulated at the 
transcriptional level, with factors such as emotional stress (e.g., 
fear) inducing an increase in GluR2 mRNA levels. [&lt;2&gt;][&lt;8&gt;] 
               | This regulation promotes a switch from GluR2-lacking to
 GluR2-containing AMPARs, enabling activity-dependent synaptic 
modifications. [&lt;2&gt;][&lt;8&gt;]  |\n| **Impact on Synaptic 
Plasticity**| The transcription-dependent switch in AMPAR subunit

 GluR2 is a pivotal modulator of AMPAR function whose regulated

&lt;h3&gt;üìö Document Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a long-lasting, transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in 
cerebellar stellate cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch involves increased &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 
mRNA&lt;/strong&gt; and synaptic incorporation of 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable 
AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt;, replacing GluR2-lacking, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable 
receptors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process is mediated by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, enhances Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry, 
and activates &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; to drive 
new GluR2 gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;phenotype switch&lt;/strong&gt; alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Fear-induced switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in cerebellar stellate 
cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable) to 
GluR2-containing 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable) receptors 
within hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch is driven by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, increases Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry,
 and activates the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt; to 
boost &lt;em&gt;GluR2&lt;/em&gt; gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic function, 
potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural networks in 
response to fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Role of noradrenaline and Œ≤-adrenergic receptors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; released during 
emotional arousal activates &lt;strong&gt;Œ≤-adrenergic 
receptors&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain, especially in cerebellar stellate
 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of Œ≤-adrenergic receptors increases action 
potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, triggering ERK/MAPK 
signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This process enables a long-lasting change in synaptic 
strength and may underlie how emotional experiences modify learning and 
memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Mechanism: Action potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, 
ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; 
increases &lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
entry&lt;/strong&gt; through L-type channels, activating the 
&lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cascade triggers &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 gene 
transcription&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to more 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses and a 
switch in receptor phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-dependent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; involves long-lasting changes in synaptic 
strength that require new gene transcription, such as the 
noradrenaline-triggered switch to GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear 
stimuli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; relies on rapid mechanisms like receptor 
trafficking or local protein synthesis, enabling fast changes in 
synaptic function without altering gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Transcription-dependent changes occur over hours and affect the whole 
neuron, while transcription-independent changes happen within minutes 
and are often synapse-specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Functional consequences for inhibitory neural 
circuits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhibitory neural circuits&lt;/strong&gt; can 
undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength when a single 
fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent upregulation of 
GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch reduces 
&lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
permeability&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses, altering &lt;strong&gt;synaptic
 efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; and 
&lt;strong&gt;action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; are key signals
 that activate the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt;, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.&lt;/li&gt;

their ability to promote GluR2 gene transcription, which leads to a 
transcription-dependent increase in GluR2 mRNA levels; this increase is 
confirmed by the observation that inhibition of gene transcription with

their ability to promote GluR2 gene transcription, which leads to a 
transcription-dependent increase in GluR2 mRNA levels; this increase is

&lt;p&gt;In summary, GluR2 is a pivotal modulator of AMPAR function 
whose regulated expression and incorporation into synapses enable the 
nervous system to adjust synaptic efficacy in response to 
experience-dependent stimuli.&amp;lt;span

&lt;p&gt;In summary, GluR2 is a pivotal modulator of AMPAR function 
whose regulated expression and incorporation into synapses enable the 
nervous system to adjust synaptic efficacy in response to

&lt;strong&gt;signaling pathway steps&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äîfor instance, 
detailing how action potential broadening (with a change $\Delta t$) 
increases Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry ($\Delta 
[Ca^{2+}]$) and subsequently activates the ERK/MAPK pathway (with rate 
constant $k_{ERK}$), as supported by the experimental data in the paper?

&lt;h3&gt;üìö Document Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a long-lasting, transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in 
cerebellar stellate cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch involves increased &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 
mRNA&lt;/strong&gt; and synaptic incorporation of 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable 
AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt;, replacing GluR2-lacking, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable 
receptors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process is mediated by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, enhances Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry, 
and activates &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; to drive 
new GluR2 gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;phenotype switch&lt;/strong&gt; alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Fear-induced switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in cerebellar stellate 
cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable) to 
GluR2-containing 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable) receptors 
within hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch is driven by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, increases Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry,
 and activates the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt; to 
boost &lt;em&gt;GluR2&lt;/em&gt; gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic function, 
potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural networks in 
response to fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Role of noradrenaline and Œ≤-adrenergic receptors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; released during 
emotional arousal activates &lt;strong&gt;Œ≤-adrenergic 
receptors&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain, especially in cerebellar stellate
 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of Œ≤-adrenergic receptors increases action 
potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, triggering ERK/MAPK 
signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This process enables a long-lasting change in synaptic 
strength and may underlie how emotional experiences modify learning and 
memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Mechanism: Action potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, 
ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; 
increases &lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
entry&lt;/strong&gt; through L-type channels, activating the 
&lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cascade triggers &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 gene 
transcription&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to more 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses and a 
switch in receptor phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-dependent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; involves long-lasting changes in synaptic 
strength that require new gene transcription, such as the 
noradrenaline-triggered switch to GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear 
stimuli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; relies on rapid mechanisms like receptor 
trafficking or local protein synthesis, enabling fast changes in 
synaptic function without altering gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Transcription-dependent changes occur over hours and affect the whole 
neuron, while transcription-independent changes happen within minutes 
and are often synapse-specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Functional consequences for inhibitory neural 
circuits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhibitory neural circuits&lt;/strong&gt; can 
undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength when a single 
fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent upregulation of 
GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch reduces 
&lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
permeability&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses, altering &lt;strong&gt;synaptic
 efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; and 
&lt;strong&gt;action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; are key signals
 that activate the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt;, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.&lt;/li&gt;

their ability to promote GluR2 gene transcription, which leads to a 
transcription-dependent increase in GluR2 mRNA levels; this increase is 
confirmed by the observation that inhibition of gene transcription with

&lt;li&gt;The phosphorylation of these transcription factors enhances 
their ability to promote GluR2 gene transcription, which leads to a 
transcription-dependent increase in GluR2 mRNA levels; this increase is 
confirmed by the observation that inhibition of gene transcription with 
actinomycin D prevents the rise in GluR2 mRNA and the subsequent

%20Noradrenaline%20markedly%20increased%20the%20number%20of%20cells%20expressing%20GluR2%20mRNA%20and%20the%20intensity%20of%20GluR2%20mRNA%20expres%C2%AD%20sion%20in%20individual%20cells%20in%20the%20molecular%20layer%20(Fig.

&lt;p&gt;In summary, GluR2 is a pivotal modulator of AMPAR function 
whose regulated expression and incorporation into synapses enable the 
nervous system to adjust synaptic efficacy in response to 
experience-dependent stimuli.&amp;lt;span

%20This%20mechanism%20requires%20activation%20of%20synaptic%20glutamate%20receptors%20and%20involves%20interactions%20with%20PICK1%2C%20NSF%20and%20GRIP29%2C30%2C36%2C37.

detailing how action potential broadening (with a change $\Delta t$) 
increases Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry ($\Delta 
[Ca^{2+}]$) and subsequently activates the ERK/MAPK pathway (with rate 
constant $k_{ERK}$), as supported by the experimental data in the paper?

detailing how action potential broadening (with a change $\Delta t$) 
increases Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry ($\Delta
