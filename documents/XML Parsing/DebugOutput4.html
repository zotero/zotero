removed:\n\n---\n\n### 👋 Welcome to DeepTutor!\n\nI'm your AI tutor 🤖 
ready to help you understand this document.\n\n### 💡 Key Takeaway\n🧠 
**A single fear-inducing stimulus triggers a long-lasting, 
transcription-dependent switch in synaptic **AMPAR** phenotype in 
cerebellar stellate cells—via noradrenaline, action potential 
broadening, Ca$^{2+}$ influx, and ERK/MAPK signaling—that increases 
synaptic incorporation of GluR2-containing, Ca$^{2+}$-impermeable **AMPA
 receptors**.**\n\n### 📚 Document Overview\n- **A single fear-inducing 
stimulus** triggers a long-lasting, transcription-dependent switch in 
synaptic **AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype** in cerebellar stellate 
cells.\n- This switch involves increased **GluR2 mRNA** and synaptic 
incorporation of **GluR2-containing, Ca$^{2+}$-impermeable AMPARs**, 
replacing GluR2-lacking, Ca$^{2+}$-permeable receptors.\n- The process 
is mediated by **noradrenaline**, which prolongs action potentials, 
enhances Ca$^{2+}$ entry, and activates **ERK/MAPK signaling** to drive 
new GluR2 gene transcription.\n- This **phenotype switch** alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.\n\n### 📌 Fear-induced switch in synaptic 
AMPAR phenotype\n- A **single fear-inducing stimulus** triggers a 
transcription-dependent switch in synaptic **AMPAR phenotype** in 
cerebellar stellate cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca$^{2+}$-permeable) to GluR2-containing (Ca$^{2+}$-impermeable) 
receptors within hours.\n- This switch is driven by **noradrenaline**, 
which prolongs action potentials, increases Ca$^{2+}$ entry, and 
activates the **ERK/MAPK pathway** to boost *GluR2* gene 
transcription.\n- The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic 
function, potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural 
networks in response to fear.\n\n### 📌 Role of noradrenaline and 
β-adrenergic receptors\n- **Noradrenaline** released during emotional 
arousal activates **β-adrenergic receptors** in the brain, especially in
 cerebellar stellate cells.\n- Activation of β-adrenergic receptors 
increases action potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, 
triggering ERK/MAPK signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a 
switch in synaptic **AMPAR phenotype**.\n- This process enables a 
long-lasting change in synaptic strength and may underlie how emotional 
experiences modify learning and memory.\n\n### 📌 Mechanism: Action 
potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 
transcription\n- **Action potential broadening** increases **Ca$^{2+}$ 
entry** through L-type channels, activating the **ERK/MAPK signaling** 
pathway.\n- This cascade triggers **GluR2 gene transcription**, leading 
to more **GluR2-containing AMPARs** at synapses and a switch in receptor
 phenotype.\n\n### 📌 Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity\n- **Transcription-dependent synaptic plasticity** involves 
long-lasting changes in synaptic strength that require new gene 
transcription, such as the noradrenaline-triggered switch to 
GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear stimuli.\n- 
**Transcription-independent synaptic plasticity** relies on rapid 
mechanisms like receptor trafficking or local protein synthesis, 
enabling fast changes in synaptic function without altering gene 
expression.\n- **Key difference:** Transcription-dependent changes occur
 over hours and affect the whole neuron, while transcription-independent
 changes happen within minutes and are often synapse-specific.\n\n### 📌
 Functional consequences for inhibitory neural circuits\n- **Inhibitory 
neural circuits** can undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength 
when a single fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent 
upregulation of GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.\n- This 
switch reduces **Ca$^{2+}$ permeability** at synapses, altering 
**synaptic efficacy** and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.\n- **Noradrenaline** and **action potential 
broadening** are key signals that activate the **ERK/MAPK pathway**, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.\n\n---\n### 💬 Ask

\n| **ERK Definition**      | ERK stands for extracellular 
signal‑regulated kinase and is a member of the MAPK family, acting as a 
key intracellular signaling molecule [&lt;1&gt;][&lt;4&gt;].       | It 
mediates synaptic plasticity by serving as a central component in the 
signaling cascade that regulates gene transcription 
[&lt;1&gt;][&lt;4&gt;].                                  |\n| 
**Activation Trigger**  | The ERK/MAPK pathway is activated by Ca²⁺ 
influx through L‑type Ca²⁺ channels, which occurs following action 
potential broadening induced by noradrenaline or TEA treatment 
[&lt;1&gt;][&lt;3&gt;]. | This Ca²⁺ entry is essential for initiating 
the cascade that ultimately leads to increased GluR2 gene transcription 
[&lt;1&gt;][&lt;4&gt;].                                               
|\n| **Signaling Cascade**   | Activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway leads 
to a series of phosphorylation events that activate transcription 
factors [&lt;1&gt;][&lt;2&gt;].                                | These 
phosphorylation events constitute an intracellular signaling cascade 
that links changes in neuronal electrical activity to alterations in 
gene expression [&lt;1&gt;][&lt;2&gt;]. |\n| **Transcriptional Effects**
 | The ERK/MAPK-mediated phosphorylation activates transcription factors
 that increase the transcription of the GluR2 gene, encoding an AMPAR 
subunit [&lt;1&gt;][&lt;3&gt;].             | Elevated GluR2 mRNA levels
 promote the synthesis of GluR2-containing receptors, shifting the 
synaptic AMPAR phenotype [&lt;3&gt;][&lt;4&gt;].                        
                       |\n| **Functional Outcome**  | Increased GluR2 
gene transcription results in the synaptic incorporation of 
GluR2-containing, Ca²⁺‑impermeable AMPARs [&lt;1&gt;][&lt;4&gt;].       
                     | This subunit switch at synapses alters synaptic 
transmission and contributes to long-lasting changes in synaptic 
efficacy and plasticity [&lt;1&gt;][&lt;4&gt;].                         
|\n\nIn summary, the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway is essential for linking
 Ca²⁺‑dependent electrical activity (via action potential broadening) to
 transcriptional regulation of the GluR2 gene, thereby driving a 
transcription‑dependent switch in the synaptic AMPAR phenotype

aptic incorporation of GluR2 subunits in cerebellar stellate cells. 
Targeted expression of GluR2 in inhibitory interneurons disrupts 
long-range syn­ chrony of gamma oscillations in the hippocampus27. Thus,
 an alteration in GluR2 gene expression could have profound consequences
 on neuronal function and the activity of neuronal circuits. We examined
 the effect of emotional arousal in the intact mouse on AMPAR GluR2 
transcription and synaptic AMPAR phenotype. We found that a single 
fear-inducing stimulus acted via β-adrenergic receptors to increase 
GluR2 mRNA abundance and alter synaptic AMPAR phenotype in cerebellar 
stellate cells. We further elu­ cidated the mechanism by which the 
switch in AMPAR phenotype occurred. Noradrenaline prolonged the action

 the Ca2+-sensitive ERK/MAPK pathway, which drives transcription of

examined the effect of actinomycin D on this phenomenon. We stimulated 
parallel fibers with 100 bursts of 4 depolarizations (at 37 °C) over a 
period of 10 min and measured the synaptic currents at −60 and +40 mV. 
High­frequency stimulation induced an increase in EPSC amplitude ratio

&lt;h3&gt;📚 Document Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a long-lasting, transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in 
cerebellar stellate cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch involves increased &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 
mRNA&lt;/strong&gt; and synaptic incorporation of 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable 
AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt;, replacing GluR2-lacking, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable 
receptors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process is mediated by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, enhances Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry, 
and activates &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; to drive 
new GluR2 gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;phenotype switch&lt;/strong&gt; alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Fear-induced switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in cerebellar stellate 
cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable) to 
GluR2-containing 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable) receptors 
within hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch is driven by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, increases Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry,
 and activates the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt; to 
boost &lt;em&gt;GluR2&lt;/em&gt; gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic function, 
potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural networks in 
response to fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Role of noradrenaline and β-adrenergic receptors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; released during 
emotional arousal activates &lt;strong&gt;β-adrenergic 
receptors&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain, especially in cerebellar stellate
 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of β-adrenergic receptors increases action 
potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, triggering ERK/MAPK 
signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This process enables a long-lasting change in synaptic 
strength and may underlie how emotional experiences modify learning and 
memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Mechanism: Action potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, 
ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; 
increases &lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
entry&lt;/strong&gt; through L-type channels, activating the 
&lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cascade triggers &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 gene 
transcription&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to more 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses and a 
switch in receptor phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-dependent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; involves long-lasting changes in synaptic 
strength that require new gene transcription, such as the 
noradrenaline-triggered switch to GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear 
stimuli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; relies on rapid mechanisms like receptor 
trafficking or local protein synthesis, enabling fast changes in 
synaptic function without altering gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Transcription-dependent changes occur over hours and affect the whole 
neuron, while transcription-independent changes happen within minutes 
and are often synapse-specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Functional consequences for inhibitory neural 
circuits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhibitory neural circuits&lt;/strong&gt; can 
undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength when a single 
fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent upregulation of 
GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch reduces 
&lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
permeability&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses, altering &lt;strong&gt;synaptic
 efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; and 
&lt;strong&gt;action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; are key signals
 that activate the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt;, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;This cascade triggers &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 gene 
transcription&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to more 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses and a 
switch in receptor phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-dependent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; involves long-lasting changes in synaptic 
strength that require new gene transcription, such as the 
noradrenaline-triggered switch to GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear 
stimuli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; relies on rapid mechanisms like receptor 
trafficking or local protein synthesis, enabling fast changes in 
synaptic function without altering gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Transcription-dependent changes occur over hours and affect the whole 
neuron, while transcription-independent changes happen within minutes 
and are often synapse-specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Functional consequences for inhibitory neural 
circuits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhibitory neural circuits&lt;/strong&gt; can 
undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength when a single 
fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent upregulation of 
GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch reduces 
&lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
permeability&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses, altering &lt;strong&gt;synaptic
 efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; and 
&lt;strong&gt;action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; are key signals
 that activate the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt;, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📚 Document Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a long-lasting, transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in 
cerebellar stellate cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch involves increased &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 
mRNA&lt;/strong&gt; and synaptic incorporation of 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable 
AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt;, replacing GluR2-lacking, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable 
receptors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process is mediated by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, enhances Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry, 
and activates &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; to drive 
new GluR2 gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;phenotype switch&lt;/strong&gt; alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Fear-induced switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in cerebellar stellate 
cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable) to 
GluR2-containing 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable) receptors 
within hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch is driven by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, increases Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry,
 and activates the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt; to 
boost &lt;em&gt;GluR2&lt;/em&gt; gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic function, 
potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural networks in 
response to fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Role of noradrenaline and β-adrenergic receptors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; released during 
emotional arousal activates &lt;strong&gt;β-adrenergic 
receptors&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain, especially in cerebellar stellate
 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of β-adrenergic receptors increases action 
potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, triggering ERK/MAPK 
signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This process enables a long-lasting change in synaptic 
strength and may underlie how emotional experiences modify learning and 
memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Mechanism: Action potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, 
ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; 
increases &lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
entry&lt;/strong&gt; through L-type channels, activating the 
&lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cascade triggers &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 gene 
transcription&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to more 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses and a 
switch in receptor phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-dependent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; involves long-lasting changes in synaptic 
strength that require new gene transcription, such as the 
noradrenaline-triggered switch to GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear 
stimuli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; relies on rapid mechanisms like receptor 
trafficking or local protein synthesis, enabling fast changes in 
synaptic function without altering gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Transcription-dependent changes occur over hours and affect the whole 
neuron, while transcription-independent changes happen within minutes 
and are often synapse-specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Functional consequences for inhibitory neural 
circuits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhibitory neural circuits&lt;/strong&gt; can 
undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength when a single 
fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent upregulation of 
GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch reduces 
&lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
permeability&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses, altering &lt;strong&gt;synaptic
 efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; and 
&lt;strong&gt;action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; are key signals
 that activate the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt;, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.&lt;/li&gt;

signaling—that increases synaptic incorporation of GluR2-containing,

&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📚 Document Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a long-lasting, transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in 
cerebellar stellate cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch involves increased &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 
mRNA&lt;/strong&gt; and synaptic incorporation of 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable 
AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt;, replacing GluR2-lacking, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable 
receptors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process is mediated by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, enhances Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry, 
and activates &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; to drive 
new GluR2 gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;phenotype switch&lt;/strong&gt; alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Fear-induced switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in cerebellar stellate 
cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable) to 
GluR2-containing 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable) receptors 
within hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch is driven by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, increases Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry,
 and activates the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt; to 
boost &lt;em&gt;GluR2&lt;/em&gt; gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic function, 
potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural networks in 
response to fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Role of noradrenaline and β-adrenergic receptors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; released during 
emotional arousal activates &lt;strong&gt;β-adrenergic 
receptors&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain, especially in cerebellar stellate
 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of β-adrenergic receptors increases action 
potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, triggering ERK/MAPK 
signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This process enables a long-lasting change in synaptic 
strength and may underlie how emotional experiences modify learning and 
memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Mechanism: Action potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, 
ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; 
increases &lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
entry&lt;/strong&gt; through L-type channels, activating the 
&lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cascade triggers &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 gene 
transcription&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to more 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses and a 
switch in receptor phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-dependent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; involves long-lasting changes in synaptic 
strength that require new gene transcription, such as the 
noradrenaline-triggered switch to GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear 
stimuli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; relies on rapid mechanisms like receptor 
trafficking or local protein synthesis, enabling fast changes in 
synaptic function without altering gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Transcription-dependent changes occur over hours and affect the whole 
neuron, while transcription-independent changes happen within minutes 
and are often synapse-specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Functional consequences for inhibitory neural 
circuits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhibitory neural circuits&lt;/strong&gt; can 
undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength when a single 
fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent upregulation of 
GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch reduces 
&lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
permeability&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses, altering &lt;strong&gt;synaptic
 efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; and 
&lt;strong&gt;action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; are key signals
 that activate the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt;, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role of L-type Ca²⁺ 
Channels:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br//&gt;
In cerebellar stellate cells, L-type Ca²⁺ channels mediate a significant
 Ca²⁺ influx during action potential broadening, which is crucial for 
activating the Ca²⁺-sensitive ERK/MAPK signaling pathway that ultimately
 triggers GluR2 gene transcription and the synaptic switch from 
Ca²⁺-permeable to Ca²⁺-impermeable AMPARs

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact of Blocking These 
Channels:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br//&gt;
Blocking L-type Ca²⁺ channels (e.g., using nifedipine) reduces or

broadening, thereby impairing the activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway

&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📚 Document Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a long-lasting, transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in 
cerebellar stellate cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch involves increased &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 
mRNA&lt;/strong&gt; and synaptic incorporation of 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable 
AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt;, replacing GluR2-lacking, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable 
receptors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process is mediated by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, enhances Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry, 
and activates &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; to drive 
new GluR2 gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;phenotype switch&lt;/strong&gt; alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Fear-induced switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in cerebellar stellate 
cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable) to 
GluR2-containing 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable) receptors 
within hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch is driven by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, increases Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry,
 and activates the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt; to 
boost &lt;em&gt;GluR2&lt;/em&gt; gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic function, 
potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural networks in 
response to fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Role of noradrenaline and β-adrenergic receptors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; released during 
emotional arousal activates &lt;strong&gt;β-adrenergic 
receptors&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain, especially in cerebellar stellate
 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of β-adrenergic receptors increases action 
potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, triggering ERK/MAPK 
signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This process enables a long-lasting change in synaptic 
strength and may underlie how emotional experiences modify learning and 
memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Mechanism: Action potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, 
ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; 
increases &lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
entry&lt;/strong&gt; through L-type channels, activating the 
&lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cascade triggers &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 gene 
transcription&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to more 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses and a 
switch in receptor phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-dependent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; involves long-lasting changes in synaptic 
strength that require new gene transcription, such as the 
noradrenaline-triggered switch to GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear 
stimuli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; relies on rapid mechanisms like receptor 
trafficking or local protein synthesis, enabling fast changes in 
synaptic function without altering gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Transcription-dependent changes occur over hours and affect the whole 
neuron, while transcription-independent changes happen within minutes 
and are often synapse-specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Functional consequences for inhibitory neural 
circuits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhibitory neural circuits&lt;/strong&gt; can 
undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength when a single 
fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent upregulation of 
GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch reduces 
&lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
permeability&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses, altering &lt;strong&gt;synaptic
 efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; and 
&lt;strong&gt;action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; are key signals
 that activate the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt;, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.&lt;/li&gt;

signaling—that increases synaptic incorporation of GluR2-containing,

&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📚 Document Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a long-lasting, transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in 
cerebellar stellate cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch involves increased &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 
mRNA&lt;/strong&gt; and synaptic incorporation of 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable 
AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt;, replacing GluR2-lacking, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable 
receptors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process is mediated by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, enhances Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry, 
and activates &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; to drive 
new GluR2 gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;phenotype switch&lt;/strong&gt; alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Fear-induced switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in cerebellar stellate 
cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable) to 
GluR2-containing 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable) receptors 
within hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch is driven by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, increases Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry,
 and activates the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt; to 
boost &lt;em&gt;GluR2&lt;/em&gt; gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic function, 
potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural networks in 
response to fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Role of noradrenaline and β-adrenergic receptors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; released during 
emotional arousal activates &lt;strong&gt;β-adrenergic 
receptors&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain, especially in cerebellar stellate
 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of β-adrenergic receptors increases action 
potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, triggering ERK/MAPK 
signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This process enables a long-lasting change in synaptic 
strength and may underlie how emotional experiences modify learning and 
memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Mechanism: Action potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, 
ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; 
increases &lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
entry&lt;/strong&gt; through L-type channels, activating the 
&lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cascade triggers &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 gene 
transcription&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to more 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses and a 
switch in receptor phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-dependent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; involves long-lasting changes in synaptic 
strength that require new gene transcription, such as the 
noradrenaline-triggered switch to GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear 
stimuli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; relies on rapid mechanisms like receptor 
trafficking or local protein synthesis, enabling fast changes in 
synaptic function without altering gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Transcription-dependent changes occur over hours and affect the whole 
neuron, while transcription-independent changes happen within minutes 
and are often synapse-specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Functional consequences for inhibitory neural 
circuits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhibitory neural circuits&lt;/strong&gt; can 
undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength when a single 
fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent upregulation of 
GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch reduces 
&lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
permeability&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses, altering &lt;strong&gt;synaptic
 efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; and 
&lt;strong&gt;action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; are key signals
 that activate the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt;, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🧠 &lt;strong&gt;A single fear-inducing stimulus triggers a

cells—via noradrenaline, action potential broadening,

signaling—that increases synaptic incorporation of GluR2-containing, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📚 Document Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a long-lasting, transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in 
cerebellar stellate cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch involves increased &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 
mRNA&lt;/strong&gt; and synaptic incorporation of 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable 
AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt;, replacing GluR2-lacking, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable 
receptors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process is mediated by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, enhances Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry, 
and activates &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; to drive 
new GluR2 gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;phenotype switch&lt;/strong&gt; alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Fear-induced switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in cerebellar stellate 
cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable) to 
GluR2-containing 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable) receptors 
within hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch is driven by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, increases Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry,
 and activates the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt; to 
boost &lt;em&gt;GluR2&lt;/em&gt; gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic function, 
potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural networks in 
response to fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Role of noradrenaline and β-adrenergic receptors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; released during 
emotional arousal activates &lt;strong&gt;β-adrenergic 
receptors&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain, especially in cerebellar stellate
 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of β-adrenergic receptors increases action 
potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, triggering ERK/MAPK 
signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This process enables a long-lasting change in synaptic 
strength and may underlie how emotional experiences modify learning and 
memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Mechanism: Action potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, 
ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; 
increases &lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
entry&lt;/strong&gt; through L-type channels, activating the 
&lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cascade triggers &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 gene 
transcription&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to more 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses and a 
switch in receptor phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-dependent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; involves long-lasting changes in synaptic 
strength that require new gene transcription, such as the 
noradrenaline-triggered switch to GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear 
stimuli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; relies on rapid mechanisms like receptor 
trafficking or local protein synthesis, enabling fast changes in 
synaptic function without altering gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Transcription-dependent changes occur over hours and affect the whole 
neuron, while transcription-independent changes happen within minutes 
and are often synapse-specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Functional consequences for inhibitory neural 
circuits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhibitory neural circuits&lt;/strong&gt; can 
undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength when a single 
fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent upregulation of 
GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch reduces 
&lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
permeability&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses, altering &lt;strong&gt;synaptic
 efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; and 
&lt;strong&gt;action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; are key signals
 that activate the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt;, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.&lt;/li&gt;

within hours.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic function, 
potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural networks in 
response to fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Role of noradrenaline and β-adrenergic receptors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; released during 
emotional arousal activates &lt;strong&gt;β-adrenergic 
receptors&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain, especially in cerebellar stellate
 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of β-adrenergic receptors increases action 
potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, triggering ERK/MAPK 
signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a switch in synaptic

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; 
increases &lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
entry&lt;/strong&gt; through L-type channels, activating the 
&lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cascade triggers &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 gene

&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📚 Document Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a long-lasting, transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in 
cerebellar stellate cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch involves increased &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 
mRNA&lt;/strong&gt; and synaptic incorporation of 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable 
AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt;, replacing GluR2-lacking, 
Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable 
receptors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process is mediated by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, enhances Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry, 
and activates &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; to drive 
new GluR2 gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;phenotype switch&lt;/strong&gt; alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Fear-induced switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in cerebellar stellate 
cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-permeable) to 
GluR2-containing 
(Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-impermeable) receptors 
within hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch is driven by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, increases Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; entry,
 and activates the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt; to 
boost &lt;em&gt;GluR2&lt;/em&gt; gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic function, 
potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural networks in 
response to fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Role of noradrenaline and β-adrenergic receptors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; released during 
emotional arousal activates &lt;strong&gt;β-adrenergic 
receptors&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain, especially in cerebellar stellate
 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of β-adrenergic receptors increases action 
potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, triggering ERK/MAPK 
signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This process enables a long-lasting change in synaptic 
strength and may underlie how emotional experiences modify learning and 
memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Mechanism: Action potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, 
ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; 
increases &lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
entry&lt;/strong&gt; through L-type channels, activating the 
&lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cascade triggers &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 gene 
transcription&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to more 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses and a 
switch in receptor phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-dependent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; involves long-lasting changes in synaptic 
strength that require new gene transcription, such as the 
noradrenaline-triggered switch to GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear 
stimuli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; relies on rapid mechanisms like receptor 
trafficking or local protein synthesis, enabling fast changes in 
synaptic function without altering gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Transcription-dependent changes occur over hours and affect the whole 
neuron, while transcription-independent changes happen within minutes 
and are often synapse-specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📌 Functional consequences for inhibitory neural 
circuits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhibitory neural circuits&lt;/strong&gt; can 
undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength when a single 
fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent upregulation of 
GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch reduces 
&lt;strong&gt;Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; 
permeability&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses, altering &lt;strong&gt;synaptic
 efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; and 
&lt;strong&gt;action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; are key signals
 that activate the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt;, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.&lt;/li&gt;
