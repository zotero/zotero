{"text":"Here is your refined summary with duplicated section titles 
removed:\n\n---\n\n### üëã Welcome to DeepTutor!\n\nI'm your AI tutor ü§ñ 
ready to help you understand this document.\n\n### üí° Key Takeaway\nüß† 
**A single fear-inducing stimulus triggers a long-lasting, 
transcription-dependent switch in synaptic **AMPAR** phenotype in 
cerebellar stellate cells‚Äîvia noradrenaline, action potential 
broadening, Ca$^{2+}$ influx, and ERK/MAPK signaling‚Äîthat increases 
synaptic incorporation of GluR2-containing, Ca$^{2+}$-impermeable **AMPA
 receptors**.**\n\n### üìö Document Overview\n- **A single fear-inducing 
stimulus** triggers a long-lasting, transcription-dependent switch in 
synaptic **AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype** in cerebellar stellate 
cells.\n- This switch involves increased **GluR2 mRNA** and synaptic 
incorporation of **GluR2-containing, Ca$^{2+}$-impermeable AMPARs**, 
replacing GluR2-lacking, Ca$^{2+}$-permeable receptors.\n- The process 
is mediated by **noradrenaline**, which prolongs action potentials, 
enhances Ca$^{2+}$ entry, and activates **ERK/MAPK signaling** to drive 
new GluR2 gene transcription.\n- This **phenotype switch** alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.\n\n### üìå Fear-induced switch in synaptic 
AMPAR phenotype\n- A **single fear-inducing stimulus** triggers a 
transcription-dependent switch in synaptic **AMPAR phenotype** in 
cerebellar stellate cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca$^{2+}$-permeable) to GluR2-containing (Ca$^{2+}$-impermeable) 
receptors within hours.\n- This switch is driven by **noradrenaline**, 
which prolongs action potentials, increases Ca$^{2+}$ entry, and 
activates the **ERK/MAPK pathway** to boost *GluR2* gene 
transcription.\n- The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic 
function, potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural 
networks in response to fear.\n\n### üìå Role of noradrenaline and 
Œ≤-adrenergic receptors\n- **Noradrenaline** released during emotional 
arousal activates **Œ≤-adrenergic receptors** in the brain, especially in
 cerebellar stellate cells.\n- Activation of Œ≤-adrenergic receptors 
increases action potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, 
triggering ERK/MAPK signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a 
switch in synaptic **AMPAR phenotype**.\n- This process enables a 
long-lasting change in synaptic strength and may underlie how emotional 
experiences modify learning and memory.\n\n### üìå Mechanism: Action 
potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 
transcription\n- **Action potential broadening** increases **Ca$^{2+}$ 
entry** through L-type channels, activating the **ERK/MAPK signaling** 
pathway.\n- This cascade triggers **GluR2 gene transcription**, leading 
to more **GluR2-containing AMPARs** at synapses and a switch in receptor
 phenotype.\n\n### üìå Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity\n- **Transcription-dependent synaptic plasticity** involves 
long-lasting changes in synaptic strength that require new gene 
transcription, such as the noradrenaline-triggered switch to 
GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear stimuli.\n- 
**Transcription-independent synaptic plasticity** relies on rapid 
mechanisms like receptor trafficking or local protein synthesis, 
enabling fast changes in synaptic function without altering gene 
expression.\n- **Key difference:** Transcription-dependent changes occur
 over hours and affect the whole neuron, while transcription-independent
 changes happen within minutes and are often synapse-specific.\n\n### üìå
 Functional consequences for inhibitory neural circuits\n- **Inhibitory 
neural circuits** can undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength 
when a single fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent 
upregulation of GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.\n- This 
switch reduces **Ca$^{2+}$ permeability** at synapses, altering 
**synaptic efficacy** and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.\n- **Noradrenaline** and **action potential 
broadening** are key signals that activate the **ERK/MAPK pathway**, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.\n\n---\n### üí¨ Ask

\n| **ERK Definition**      | ERK stands for extracellular 
signal‚Äëregulated kinase and is a member of the MAPK family, acting as a 
key intracellular signaling molecule [&lt;1&gt;][&lt;4&gt;].       | It 
mediates synaptic plasticity by serving as a central component in the 
signaling cascade that regulates gene transcription 
[&lt;1&gt;][&lt;4&gt;].                                  |\n| 
**Activation Trigger**  | The ERK/MAPK pathway is activated by Ca¬≤‚Å∫ 
influx through L‚Äëtype Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channels, which occurs following action 
potential broadening induced by noradrenaline or TEA treatment 
[&lt;1&gt;][&lt;3&gt;]. | This Ca¬≤‚Å∫ entry is essential for initiating 
the cascade that ultimately leads to increased GluR2 gene transcription 
[&lt;1&gt;][&lt;4&gt;].                                               
|\n| **Signaling Cascade**   | Activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway leads 
to a series of phosphorylation events that activate transcription 
factors [&lt;1&gt;][&lt;2&gt;].                                | These 
phosphorylation events constitute an intracellular signaling cascade 
that links changes in neuronal electrical activity to alterations in 
gene expression [&lt;1&gt;][&lt;2&gt;]. |\n| **Transcriptional Effects**
 | The ERK/MAPK-mediated phosphorylation activates transcription factors
 that increase the transcription of the GluR2 gene, encoding an AMPAR 
subunit [&lt;1&gt;][&lt;3&gt;].             | Elevated GluR2 mRNA levels
 promote the synthesis of GluR2-containing receptors, shifting the 
synaptic AMPAR phenotype [&lt;3&gt;][&lt;4&gt;].                        
                       |\n| **Functional Outcome**  | Increased GluR2 
gene transcription results in the synaptic incorporation of 
GluR2-containing, Ca¬≤‚Å∫‚Äëimpermeable AMPARs [&lt;1&gt;][&lt;4&gt;].       
                     | This subunit switch at synapses alters synaptic 
transmission and contributes to long-lasting changes in synaptic 
efficacy and plasticity [&lt;1&gt;][&lt;4&gt;].

hippocampal neurons10 and enhances the synthesis of GluR2 in the 
dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area9. Our results suggest 
that noradrenaline increases action-¬≠potential duration and Ca2+ entry, 
which regulates GluR2 transcription. In cerebellar stellate cells, 
elevated Ca2+ influx through L-type channels during a postsynaptic 
action potential elevates GluR2 mRNA and thereby increases the number of
 synaptic GluR2-containing receptors. Thus, newly synthesized AMPARs are
 ultimately incorporated via receptor trafficking at stellate cell syn¬≠ 
apses, a mechanism that may involve interactions with PICK1 and 
GRIP36,37. This modification would be expected to reduce the Ca2+ 
permeability of synaptic AMPARs and alter short-term synaptic plas¬≠ 
ticity26,47, producing a qualitative change in synaptic transmission. 
Dynamic regulation of AMPAR transcription may provide a mecha¬≠ nism for 
homeostatic control of synaptic transmission48. Such a tran¬≠

Ca¬≤‚Å∫-sensitive ERK/MAPK signaling pathway that ultimately triggers GluR2
 gene transcription and the synaptic switch from Ca¬≤‚Å∫-permeable to

the amplitude of the after-¬≠hyperpolarization (from ‚àí26.2 ¬± 5.4 to ‚àí22.7
 ¬± 5.5 mV, P &lt; 0.05; Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 2). Noradrenaline
 acts via Œ≤-adrenergic receptors to promote forma¬≠ tion of cAMP, which 
activates the hyperpolarization-activated inward current Ih and 
increases spike frequency in cerebellar stellate cells31. We reasoned 
that the noradrenaline-induced changes in action ¬≠potential waveform 
might arise as a result of an increase in Ih. Consistent with this, the 
Ih inhibitor ZD7288 (10 ¬µM) did not alter action potential duration, but
 abolished the noradrenaline-induced spike broadening (Supplementary 
Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, the increase in spike frequency
 and spike broadening arise, at least in part, as a result of an 
increase in Ih 
current.","refinedIndex":0,"sourceAnnotation":

&lt;h3&gt;üìö Document Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a long-lasting, transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in 
cerebellar stellate cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch involves increased &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 
mRNA&lt;/strong&gt; and synaptic incorporation of 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-impermeable 
AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt;, replacing GluR2-lacking, 
Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable receptors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process is mediated by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, enhances Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry, and activates 
&lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; to drive new GluR2 gene 
transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;phenotype switch&lt;/strong&gt; alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Fear-induced switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in cerebellar stellate 
cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable) to GluR2-containing 
(Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-impermeable) receptors within 
hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch is driven by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, increases Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry, and activates 
the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt; to boost 
&lt;em&gt;GluR2&lt;/em&gt; gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic function, 
potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural networks in 
response to fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Role of noradrenaline and Œ≤-adrenergic receptors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; released during 
emotional arousal activates &lt;strong&gt;Œ≤-adrenergic 
receptors&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain, especially in cerebellar stellate
 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of Œ≤-adrenergic receptors increases action 
potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, triggering ERK/MAPK 
signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This process enables a long-lasting change in synaptic 
strength and may underlie how emotional experiences modify learning and 
memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Mechanism: Action potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, 
ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; 
increases &lt;strong&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry&lt;/strong&gt;
 through L-type channels, activating the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK 
signaling&lt;/strong&gt; pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cascade triggers &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 gene 
transcription&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to more 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses and a 
switch in receptor phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-dependent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; involves long-lasting changes in synaptic 
strength that require new gene transcription, such as the 
noradrenaline-triggered switch to GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear 
stimuli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; relies on rapid mechanisms like receptor 
trafficking or local protein synthesis, enabling fast changes in 
synaptic function without altering gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Transcription-dependent changes occur over hours and affect the whole 
neuron, while transcription-independent changes happen within minutes 
and are often synapse-specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Functional consequences for inhibitory neural 
circuits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhibitory neural circuits&lt;/strong&gt; can 
undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength when a single 
fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent upregulation of 
GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch reduces &lt;strong&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; 
permeability&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses, altering &lt;strong&gt;synaptic
 efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; and 
&lt;strong&gt;action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; are key signals
 that activate the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt;, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in 
cerebellar stellate cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch involves increased &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 
mRNA&lt;/strong&gt; and synaptic incorporation of 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-impermeable 
AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt;, replacing GluR2-lacking, 
Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable receptors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process is mediated by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, enhances Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry, and activates 
&lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; to drive new GluR2 gene 
transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;phenotype switch&lt;/strong&gt; alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Fear-induced switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in cerebellar stellate 
cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable) to GluR2-containing 
(Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-impermeable) receptors within 
hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch is driven by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, increases Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry, and activates 
the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt; to boost 
&lt;em&gt;GluR2&lt;/em&gt; gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic function, 
potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural networks in 
response to fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Role of noradrenaline and Œ≤-adrenergic receptors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; released during 
emotional arousal activates &lt;strong&gt;Œ≤-adrenergic 
receptors&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain, especially in cerebellar stellate
 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of Œ≤-adrenergic receptors increases action 
potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, triggering ERK/MAPK 
signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This process enables a long-lasting change in synaptic 
strength and may underlie how emotional experiences modify learning and 
memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Mechanism: Action potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, 
ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; 
increases &lt;strong&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry&lt;/strong&gt;
 through L-type channels, activating the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK 
signaling&lt;/strong&gt; pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cascade triggers &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 gene 
transcription&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to more 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses and a 
switch in receptor phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-dependent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; involves long-lasting changes in synaptic 
strength that require new gene transcription, such as the 
noradrenaline-triggered switch to GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear 
stimuli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; relies on rapid mechanisms like receptor 
trafficking or local protein synthesis, enabling fast changes in 
synaptic function without altering gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Transcription-dependent changes occur over hours and affect the whole 
neuron, while transcription-independent changes happen within minutes 
and are often synapse-specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Functional consequences for inhibitory neural 
circuits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhibitory neural circuits&lt;/strong&gt; can 
undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength when a single 
fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent upregulation of 
GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch reduces &lt;strong&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; 
permeability&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses, altering &lt;strong&gt;synaptic
 efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; and 
&lt;strong&gt;action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; are key signals
 that activate the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt;, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role of L-type Ca¬≤‚Å∫ 
Channels:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In cerebellar stellate cells, L-type Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channels mediate a significant
 Ca¬≤‚Å∫ influx during action potential broadening, which is crucial for 
activating the Ca¬≤‚Å∫-sensitive ERK/MAPK signaling pathway that ultimately
 triggers GluR2 gene transcription and the synaptic switch from 
Ca¬≤‚Å∫-permeable to Ca¬≤‚Å∫-impermeable AMPARs &lt;span

&lt;p&gt;üß† &lt;strong&gt;A single fear-inducing stimulus triggers a

&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR&lt;/strong&gt; phenotype in cerebellar stellate

&lt;h3&gt;üìö Document Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a long-lasting, transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPA receptor (AMPAR) phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in 
cerebellar stellate cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch involves increased &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 
mRNA&lt;/strong&gt; and synaptic incorporation of 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-impermeable 
AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt;, replacing GluR2-lacking, 
Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable receptors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process is mediated by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, enhances Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry, and activates 
&lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK signaling&lt;/strong&gt; to drive new GluR2 gene 
transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;phenotype switch&lt;/strong&gt; alters 
synaptic efficacy and may reshape inhibitory neural network activity in 
response to emotional stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Fear-induced switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;single fear-inducing stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; 
triggers a transcription-dependent switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; in cerebellar stellate 
cells, changing from GluR2-lacking 
(Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable) to GluR2-containing 
(Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-impermeable) receptors within 
hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch is driven by 
&lt;strong&gt;noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;, which prolongs action 
potentials, increases Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry, and activates 
the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt; to boost 
&lt;em&gt;GluR2&lt;/em&gt; gene transcription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is a long-lasting change in synaptic function, 
potentially altering the activity of inhibitory neural networks in 
response to fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Role of noradrenaline and Œ≤-adrenergic receptors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; released during 
emotional arousal activates &lt;strong&gt;Œ≤-adrenergic 
receptors&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain, especially in cerebellar stellate
 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activation of Œ≤-adrenergic receptors increases action 
potential duration and intracellular $Ca^{2+}$, triggering ERK/MAPK 
signaling and transcription of GluR2, leading to a switch in synaptic 
&lt;strong&gt;AMPAR phenotype&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This process enables a long-lasting change in synaptic 
strength and may underlie how emotional experiences modify learning and 
memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Mechanism: Action potential broadening, Ca2+ entry, 
ERK/MAPK signaling, and GluR2 transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; 
increases &lt;strong&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry&lt;/strong&gt;
 through L-type channels, activating the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK 
signaling&lt;/strong&gt; pathway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This cascade triggers &lt;strong&gt;GluR2 gene 
transcription&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to more 
&lt;strong&gt;GluR2-containing AMPARs&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses and a 
switch in receptor phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Transcription-dependent vs. independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-dependent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; involves long-lasting changes in synaptic 
strength that require new gene transcription, such as the 
noradrenaline-triggered switch to GluR2-containing AMPARs after fear 
stimuli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcription-independent synaptic 
plasticity&lt;/strong&gt; relies on rapid mechanisms like receptor 
trafficking or local protein synthesis, enabling fast changes in 
synaptic function without altering gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Transcription-dependent changes occur over hours and affect the whole 
neuron, while transcription-independent changes happen within minutes 
and are often synapse-specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üìå Functional consequences for inhibitory neural 
circuits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhibitory neural circuits&lt;/strong&gt; can 
undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic strength when a single 
fear-inducing stimulus triggers transcription-dependent upregulation of 
GluR2, leading to a switch in AMPAR phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This switch reduces &lt;strong&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; 
permeability&lt;/strong&gt; at synapses, altering &lt;strong&gt;synaptic
 efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially reshaping the activity of the 
entire inhibitory network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noradrenaline&lt;/strong&gt; and 
&lt;strong&gt;action potential broadening&lt;/strong&gt; are key signals
 that activate the &lt;strong&gt;ERK/MAPK pathway&lt;/strong&gt;, 
driving these transcriptional and functional changes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role of L-type Ca¬≤‚Å∫ 
Channels:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In cerebellar stellate cells, L-type Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channels mediate a significant
 Ca¬≤‚Å∫ influx during action potential broadening, which is crucial for 
activating the Ca¬≤‚Å∫-sensitive ERK/MAPK signaling pathway that ultimately
 triggers GluR2 gene transcription and the synaptic switch from 
Ca¬≤‚Å∫-permeable to Ca¬≤‚Å∫-impermeable AMPARs &lt;span

abolishing the long-lasting, transcription-dependent synaptic plasticity
 that normally underlies the neural adaptations associated with
