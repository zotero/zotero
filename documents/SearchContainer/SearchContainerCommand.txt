The objective is to redesign the search popup logic. We want the new search popup to show container names, which the containers should be "isRegularItem" and contains the attachments, and to load the pdf attachment items if a container button is clicked. We will do the following: 1. create containerNames state, and replicate the attachmentNames useEffect loading logic to create the containerNames useEffect loading logic, which should try to get all containers (suppose isRegularItems function also works here). In best case, check in each container and only include the ones that have at least one pdf attachment; 2. In the attachment names filtering useEffect, replace attachmentNames with containerNames; 3. In attachmentNamesItemsClick function (or similar name), when a button is clicked, a container instead of attachment is now selected, so we will try to scan its attachments and load all attachments of pdf type (which we repeat existing process possibly multiple types) 4. The attached code for handling drag gives insight on handling regular items and their attachments, please try to draft code based on existing successful code 5. try to write simple and accurate code, avoid redundant or unnecessary actions 6. Don't hold back. Give it your all.
